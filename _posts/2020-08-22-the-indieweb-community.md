I've been feeling a bit lonely over these last few months. Solitude has done me good. I've learned a lot about myself that I would not otherwise have been able to discover. Lately, I've grown tired of the amount of time I have spent alone. It's become somewhat distressing.

I have made it a point to try to find new places to engage and interact with people. I do not like Zoom calls or other video chats because I find they take a lot of energy from me. When I chat online, I prefer slow communication mediums like email. I decided that I'd step out of my comfort zone and join a Slack group.

I've known about the [IndieWeb Slack community](https://indieweb.org/) for a while. I spoke with one of the founders of the IndieWeb movement, Aaron Parecki, over Slack and he referred me to the community. I had joined before but I was confused by the bridging technology and did not really engage.

## Joining a New Community

What got me thinking about the IndieWeb community is that I've been spending a lot of time working on my personal website over the last few months. It has become a source of comfort. When I don't have a project to work on, I can always tinker around with my site.

Despite my signing up to Instagram and Swarm yesterday, I am still very much a believer in owning one's own data. It is for that reason that I started to follow the IndieWeb in the first place. I believe that I should own my own website. My domain should be my own. The experience that you have on this website should be curated by me. Information should be easy to find.

These personal values all align closely with the ethos of the IndieWeb community. So, I was happy to try out their Slack channel and see whether I could find some people with whom to talk.

## The Welcome Period

I'm in what I am going to call "the welcome period" right now. I'm still very much a new member of the community. From afar, I've participated in the IndieWeb. I have built a [sourcehut uploader](https://github.com/jamesgoca/sourcehut-uploader) tool that lets you syndicate code from GitHub to sourcehut. I have joined the IndieWeb webring.

Although I am familiar with its principles, I do not know many people who are active members. I hope this changes as I start to engage with the community. Today, I have discussed my love of coffee, personal domains, and sushi. There may not be any clear rhyme to these topics but there certainly is a rhythm. I've found a lot of interesting people with whom to chat who share similar thoughts to me about the web. The chats about other topics, like coffee, are just a bonus!

I'm going to continue engaging with members and I hope to reach out to a few personally. I've been enjoying reading a few of the discussions that are going on. What I'm learning is that Slack is a great platform for community. Already, I've found great people with whom to talk.

## Syndication

This post would not be complete without talking about the quintesentially IndieWeb feature that is built-in to the community: bridging.

At first, I did not really understand bridging. Some users appeared as "apps" on the chat transcripts. I now realize that bridging lets me engage with the community via Slack while others can use platforms like IRC to talk with others. It's a way of creating a decentralized method of communication.

I really appreciate this because I am very familiar with Slack and it's always nice to join a community without having to think about learning how to use technology. The bridging feature has probably brought a lot of great minds to the community who otherwise would not have joined had the community been pinned on one platform.

What makes this so IndieWeb? You can join the community on your own terms. IRC or Slack users are welcome. This is the kind of innovation that makes me love the IndieWeb.

I'll keep you updated as my journey continues!
