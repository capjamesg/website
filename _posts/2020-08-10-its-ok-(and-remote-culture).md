title: "It's Ok (and Remote Culture)"
---

I usually write one blog post per day. I stumbled upon a web resource that I feel merits its own blog post.

I am a big believer in the UK Government's digital services. The gov.uk website is seamless. I have had many positive experiences using it for everything from finding out information about passports to applying for Self Assessment, a service for self-employed people through which they can pay their taxes.

I am not surprised to say that I have found an interesting blog post by the Government Digital Service: [It's ok to say what's ok](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/25/its-ok-to-say-whats-ok/).

I feel compelled to write my own list of things that are okay. I feel this way because I often get overwhelmed about my work. I sometimes feel like I should be working harder. I often feel like I am working too much. Those two words, it's okay, can really make a difference.

Without further ado, here is what I think it is okay to do [^1]:

- have busy days
- have quiet days
- have days where you feel like you are going to cry
- have days that you wish would never end
- close Slack so that you can work hard
- defend your own opinions in front of your manager
- be unsure about your next steps
- have a firm opinion
- be yourself
- not know the answer to a question
- take time off
- talk about non-work stuff

That last one is particularly important. We have a channel at our work called #water-fountain-convo. One of my team members has started to post daily icebreakers to encourage us to get to know each other. I feel like more of a part of the team now that we're engaging in these discussions.

Sometimes I don't have anything to say. That's okay. On those days, I like to read what everyone else has said in the chat. I've learned that some of my co-workers really like literature. I have learned that one of my co-workers has read Walden. Especially on a remote team, it's easy to forget about reaching out to your co-workers outside of work.

I think it is especially hard to bond with co-workers as a remote worker because tools like Slack feel like work. It's okay to use Slack for things other than work. Get to know your team mates. I've had a lot of fun doing it and I am only just beginning. I recently asked one of my team mates for some of their favorite introductory reads on coffee.

[^1]: This is far from a comprehensive list. I'll probably think of more to add further down the line.
